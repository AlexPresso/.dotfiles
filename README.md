## .dotfiles [WIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIP]

This is the repository where I store my dotfiles/config files with an installer
so I don't have to reinstall and configure everything byhand everytime I switch to another PC.

Feel free to use it, contribute or make suggestions but please note it's not (yet) intended to become a "generic case" installer.
