## .dotfiles

This is the repository where I store my dotfiles/config files with an installer
so I don't have to reinstall and configure everything byhand everytime I switch to another PC.

Feel free to use it, contribute or make suggestions but please note it's not (yet) intended to become a "generic case" installer.

### What's inside ?

- `alacritty`: Fast OpenGL terminal made in Rust
- Hyprland (Wayland tiling compositor), with:
  - `hyprpaper`: Wallpaper manager for Hyprland
  - `hyprlock`: Lockscreen manager for Hyprland
  - `hypridle`: Idle manager for Hyprland
- Audio:
  - `pipewire`
  - `pipewire-pulse`: allows bluetooth audio protocols handling
  - `wireplumber`: automatic switch between audio protocols
